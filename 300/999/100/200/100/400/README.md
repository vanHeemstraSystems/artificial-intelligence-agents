# 400 - Testing and Validation

1. **Create a test dataset**:
   - Develop 20-30 domain-specific questions across different DevOps areas
   - Include technical, process, and opinion-based questions
   - Have real DevOps engineers provide "gold standard" answers

2. **Run blind comparison tests**:
   - Present both AI and human answers to DevOps professionals without labeling the source
   - Have them rate responses on accuracy, authenticity, and practicality
   - Calculate a similarity score between AI and human answers

3. **Implement technical validation**:
   - Test technical accuracy with practical scenarios
   - Check for consistency in responses across similar questions
   - Verify appropriate limitations and uncertainty are expressed
