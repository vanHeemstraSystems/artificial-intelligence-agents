See [README.md](./100/README.md)

## 200 - Use real DevOps interview transcripts as training material

See [README.md](./200/README.md): TO DO

## 300 - Implement scenario-based training

See [README.md](./300/README.md): TO DO

## 400 - Focus on technical authenticity

See [README.md](./400/README.md): TO DO
